<h1>Eric Price CPR2</h1>
<h2>Paragraphs</h2>
</header>
<div id="content"
<p>The paragraph element allows text to be contained in a block display with empty spaces above and below.
This allows you to place text below headers that describes a specific topic for that header.  With the paragraph
element you have a variety of options of how to format the text.  The key for this element is expressing your 
content in a ordered manner so the reader can follow along your website with little issue.  I think this element
will become even better when you can format the content with CSS.  By changing the font or colors of the text will
grab your readers attention and make the website more visually appealing.</p>
