<h3>Step 1</h3>
<p>The very first step is to acquire a storage device with enough memory to store your torrents.  I recommend an
external hard drive with at least 1TB worth of space.  On average each movie is 800mb in size while an hour long
TV show is 400mb in size.  I personally have 2 external hard drives with a total size of 5TB.</p>
<h3>Step 2</h3>
<p>The second step is to find and download a torrent file manager.  The top 2 are <a href ="http://www.utorrent.com" target="_blank">UTorrent</a> and
<a href ="http://www.bittorrent.com" target="_blank">BitTorrent</a> These 2 programs are the most widely used out of all the available file managers
Figure out which torrent file manager interface you like and set up a file folder on your hard drive to store the torrents</p>
<h3>Step 3</h3>
<p>The next step is to find your favorite torrent websites.  The top 3 sites that I use are <a href ="http://www.eztv.it/" target="_blank">EZTV</a>
<a href ="http://www.katproxy.com/" target="_blank">Kickass</a> and <a href ="http://www.thepiratebay.sx" target="_blank">Pirate Bay</a>.
Each one of these sites focuses on a specific genre of video.  For example I get most of my TV shows from EZTV while I get my movies from either
Kickass or Pirate Bay.</p>
<h3>Step 4</h3>
<p>The following step is to make sure you have fast enough download speed from your internet provider.  Due to the size of the files having a fast
download speed allows for your torrents to complete in hours instead of days.  If you want to be able to download multiple files at a single time
you need to have at least 7mb of download speed.  I personally utilize a 12mb speed DSL connection and it works wonderfully.</p>
<h3>Step 5</h3>
<p>The final step will be to enjoy the countless shows and movies that you can download and watch at any time.</p>
